This project analyzes video game data sourced from Kaggle using Python, incorporating libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The process began with data cleaning to handle missing values and outliers, ensuring the dataset's integrity. Statistical analysis was then conducted to uncover trends and patterns within the data. Finally, Seaborn was utilized for visualizing the results, providing clear and insightful graphics. Through this comprehensive approach, significant insights into the video game industry were obtained, highlighting trends in game sales, ratings, and other key metrics, thereby demonstrating the efficacy of data science techniques in extracting valuable information from large datasets.
